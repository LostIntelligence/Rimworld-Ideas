# **$artifactScroll - The Scroll of the Triarchs**

The First Scroll is a **living Scroll and constitutional record** carried across generations.
It never changes its core doctrine. Each Triarch generation **adds to it**, never rewrites it.

It contains:

1. **The Founders’ Blueprint** - how the city must be built and governed
2. **The Triarch System Doctrine** - three leaders, divided authority, emergency protocols
3. **The Triarch Chronology** - names, achievements, and major events for each generation
4. **The Final Words of Each Triarch Generation**

It is meant to be read by future citizens, historians, and visitors as proof that the city was **built by people, not legends**.

---

## **Triarch Generations Recorded in the Scroll**

### **Generation One - The Founders**

$founderColony, $founderAway, $founderBase

* Built the original city
* Designed the Triarch governance model
* Created the Scroll and sealed the hidden mechanism

They died long before the city fell.

---

### **Generation Two - The Stewards**

$formerLeaderColony, $formerLeaderAway, $formerLeaderBase

* Expanded the city
* Refined trade, hospitality, and the museum concept
* Codified the Emergency Continuance Protocol

The city burned under their leadership.
They stayed behind to buy time.

---

### **Generation Three - The Phoenix Triarch (You)**

The first entry written after landing on the new rimworld:

> **Generation Three - The Phoenix Triarch**
> *Our city fell. The pirates burned it. The Stewards chose us and remained behind to buy us time.*
> *We carry the Scroll and the Phoenix seal.*
> *We will rise again.*
> *The city burned. The chain did not break.*

The phoenix is the city’s emblem, representing cyclical rebirth.

---

# **The Hidden Mechanism**

The First Scroll’s casing contains a **concealed compartment**, referenced repeatedly in formal mandate language:

> *“If the city falls, open the mechanism only after the new Triarch is safe and the site of rebirth is chosen.”*
>
> *“If the Triarch becomes tyrannical, the mechanism must be opened by their subordinates.”*

The mechanism is **not symbolic**.
It physically contains a second sealed document.

---

# **$artifactScrollSecond - The Founder’s Prophecy**

The Second Scroll was written by the First Leader alone.
It was sealed as a **failsafe prophecy and procedural mandate**, not a governance document.

It was **never opened by the Second Triarch**, because the First Scroll explicitly forbade it until the city had already fallen and a new site was chosen.

---

## **Text of the Second Scroll (Canonical Prophecy)**

> *“If you read this, then my system has reached its test.”*
>
> *“Whether by tyranny or by ruin, the Triarch has broken.”*
>
> *“Know this: the system was good, but no system is flawless. That is why this protocol exists.”*
>
> *“If one ruler has seized command, this scroll condemns them. The city must return to three.”*
> *“If the city burned and the Triarch enacted the Emergency Protocol, this scroll blesses you. Rebuild.”*
>
> *“I will rise again—not in war, not in command, but in guidance.”*
> *“I will break tyrants and rebuild cities.”*
> *“The chain must never break, even if the city does.”*

---

# **Doctrine of the Founder’s Return (Non-Mystical but Mythic)**

The prophecy is interpreted literally **ideologically**, not magically.

The Founder’s “return” means:

* Their blueprint is re-enforced
* Their authority supersedes current leaders in crisis
* The city must revert to First Scroll doctrine regardless of current politics
* The Triarch must be restored if lost

The Founder is envisioned as a **non-combat architect of civilization**:

* Not a warrior
* Not a ruler
* A rebuilder and system enforcer

---

# **Why the Second Triarch Never Opened It**

Not shame.
Not denial.
**Protocol.**

The First Scroll explicitly states:

* Open it **only after the city is lost and a new site is chosen**
* Tyrants will never open it themselves; subordinates must
* It is meant for **rebuilders or rebels**, not current rulers

The Stewards followed doctrine perfectly:
They stayed behind, ensured the successors fled, and never violated protocol.

---

# **Gameplay / RP Narrative Hooks**

## **The Moment of Revelation**

When your colony becomes stable and the new city site is chosen, the Third Triarch can ceremonially open the Second Scroll.

This becomes:

* A founding ritual
* Ideology reform justification
* A museum event with huge lore weight

---

## **Tyrant Contingency (Alternate Timeline)**

If you ever RP a single-leader dictatorship, you can headcanon that:

* Colonists secretly open the Second Scroll
* The Founder’s prophecy legitimizes rebellion
* Triarch restoration becomes a holy mandate

---

## **The Phoenix Chain Doctrine**

The combined prophecy is:

> Cities can burn.
> Leaders can die.
> The Triarch can fall.
>
> But as long as the Scroll survives and three rebuild, the city never truly dies.

---

# **Perfect Museum Exhibit Concept**

**Exhibit: “The Scroll and the Sealed Founder’s Testament”**

Plaque text:

> *The Scroll records every Triarch who built the city. Beneath its binding lies a sealed prophecy written by the First Leader, to be opened only if the city falls or tyranny arises. It was carried through fire and exile so the Phoenix could rise again.*

---

# **Opening Scene Flavor Text (Final Canon)**

> Three survivors kneel in dust and silence.
> They unroll centuries of history, names, and triumphs.
> At the end, ash-stained words declare the city’s death.
>
> Beneath the binding, a sealed testament waits for a fallen future.
> They do not open it yet.
>
> The phoenix burned.
> The phoenix will rise.

   * Each Triarch must preselect one successor candidate for their role.
   * The names must be recorded in the Scroll and confirmed by citizen vote.

2. **Activation Condition**

   * The successors must record the fall and vow rebirth.

**Doctrine Phrase:**

> *“A city may fall. A Triarch may die. The Chain must not.”*

---

# **II. The Chain**

### **Formal Name: $doctrineChainOfTriarchs**

**Definition:**
The Chain is the unbroken lineage of Triarch generations recorded in the Scroll, linking Founders, Stewards, and Phoenix Triarchs across time and planets.

The Chain is **not the city, not the people, not the land**.
The Chain is **memory, doctrine, and succession**.
> *“There shall be only one Scroll. Copies dilute memory; memory must be guarded, not duplicated.”*

---

### **Conditions for the Chain to Break**

The Chain is considered broken if **all** of the following occur:

1. **The Scroll is destroyed**

   * And cannot be reconstructed from memory before the death of all Triarch members and the Chronicler.

2. **No Successors Are Chosen**

   * And the Triarch dies simultaneously or within one generation.

3. **Triarch Doctrine Is Abandoned**

   * A single ruler permanently replaces the Triarch system and no restoration occurs.

**Doctrine Phrase:**

> *“As long as three remember, the city lives.”*

---

# **III. The Founder’s Vision**

### **Formal Name: $doctrineFoundersVision**

### **Why the Founders Fled**

The Founders were:

* Corporate defectors
* Cultural archivists
* Political dissidents
* Technologists who rejected megacorp governance

Their homeworlds had become:

* Hyper-centralized
* Controlled by megacorporations or AI governance
* Cities owned, not lived in

They believed **true civilization required autonomy, memory, and shared governance**.

---

### **The Vision for the City**

The city was designed to be:

1. **A Cultural Archive**

   * The museum preserves history that core worlds discard.

2. **A Free Trade Nexus**

   * Markets exist without corporate monopoly.

3. **A Refuge and Crossroads**

   * Hospitality ensures travelers and refugees integrate instead of becoming raiders.

4. **A Proof of Concept Civilization**

   * A city-state proving people can govern themselves without megacorps.

5. **A Living Scroll**

   * Every generation must record itself so history never disappears again.

**Founders’ Motto:**

> *“On the rim, history is written by those who remember.”*

---

# **IV. The Vote**

### **Formal Name: $protocolSuccessionVote**

**Purpose:**
To maintain legitimacy if a Triarch member dies before selecting a successor.

---

### **Procedure**

1. **Emergency Vacancy Declaration**

   * If a Triarch member dies without naming a successor, the remaining two must declare a vacancy.

2. **Candidate Nomination**

   * Any citizen may be nominated by:

     * The remaining Triarch members
     * A citizen council
     * Public petition

3. **Citizen Confirmation Vote**

   * Citizens vote to confirm the candidate.
   * Majority approval is required.

4. **Provisional Ascension**

   * The confirmed successor ascends as **Provisional Triarch**.
   * Full authority is granted after a ceremonial Scroll entry.

5. **Continuity Clause**

   * If multiple vacancies occur, all new Triarch members ascend simultaneously after a joint vote.

**Doctrine Phrase:**

> *“The city chooses its stewards, the Chain chooses its leaders.”*

---

# **V. Triarch Vows**

### **Formal Name: $oathTriarchVows**

Every Triarch member must swear these vows before ascension:

---

### **The Oath of Continuance**

> *“I swear to uphold the Scroll and preserve the Chain.*
> *If the city falls, I will stand or flee as doctrine commands.*
> *I will choose successors and record my deeds and failures.*
> *I will not rule alone, nor allow another to rule alone.*
> *The Triarch must remain three.”*

---

### **The Bloodline Prohibition**

> *“I will not choose successors from my direct bloodline, nor from the direct bloodlines of my co-leaders.*
> *Leadership shall never become inheritance.”*

---

### **The Citizen Confirmation Clause**

> *The Chain belongs to the city, not to me.”*

---

# **VI. Definition of Triarch Generations**

### **Formal Name: $doctrineGenerationalAscension**

---

## **What Defines a Generation**

A Triarch Generation is defined by **leadership cohort**, not time.

A new generation begins when:

* All three Triarch members ascend together, or
* A generational transition vote is held

---

## **Biological Ascension Limits**

To prevent immortal stagnation (cryptosleep, bionics, etc.), the Founders defined:

* A **Maximum Biological Age Limit** (e.g., 65-80 biological years)
* Leaders must abdicate upon reaching this limit
* Artificial life extension does not exempt abdication

This ensures ideological evolution.

---

## **Death of a Triarch Member**

If one Triarch dies:

1. The remaining two continue as **Interim Triarch**.
2. A successor is chosen by preselection or emergency vote.
3. **All three successors ascend together as the next Generation** after confirmation.

Yes—**the other two abdicate**, even if alive, to maintain generational unity.

---

### **Doctrine Phrase**

> *“A Triarch generation must rise and fall as one, so no leader outlives their era.”*

---

# **Core Philosophical Summary**

* The **city is temporary**
* The **Triarch is renewable**
* The **Chain is eternal**
* Leadership is **chosen, not inherited**
* Memory is **sacred infrastructure**

---
